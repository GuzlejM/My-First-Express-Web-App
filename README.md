#Express Routing Assignment

1. Create a brand new Express app from scratch
2. Create a package.json using `npm inut` and add express as a dependency
3. In your main app.js file, add 3 diferent routes:

Visiting "/" should print "Hi there, welcome to my assignment!"
__________________________________________________________________
Visiting "/speak/pig should print "The pig says 'Oink'"<br>
Visiting "/speak/cow should print "The cow says 'Moo'"<br>
Visiting "/speak/dog should print "The dog says 'Woof Woof'"<br>
__________________________________________________________________
Visiting "/repeat/3" should print "hello hello hello"<br>
Visiting "/repeat/5" should print "hello hello hello hello hello"<br>
Visiting "/repeat/2" should print "blah blah"<br>
__________________________________________________________________
If a user visits any other route, print:
"Sorry, page not found...What are you doing with your life?"<br>

NOTE ! Definitely need to rewatch 271. Express Basic Excercise: Solution.
